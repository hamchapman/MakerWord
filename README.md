A command line version of number plate game written in Objective-C.

Eventually I will turn this into a Mac app and potentially an iOS app. All of the basic game logic is there, I just need to create a UI and then pipe everything up so that it works and looks nice.

At the minute you can play it in the command line by cloning the app and then opening it in Xcode and then running the app there. You'll then be able to play the game in the console of Xcode.
